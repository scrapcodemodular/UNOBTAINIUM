## **About UNOBTAINIUM:**

UNOBTAINIUM is an adapter which allows the use of an Arduino Nano in place of a DIP format ATMEGA328P microcontroller - an item which is currently very difficult to get hold of due to the worldwide chip shortage!
 
It can either be soldered in place, or assembled as a removable device using the provided IC headers and sockets.
 
 
Arduino Nano sold separately.
